# Burger Bonanza front-end and back-end

This is a website for a burger restaurant called Burger Bonanza.  This is a fictional restaurant, and this project is to showcase my abilities using React/javascript for the front-end and Java/Spring Boot for the back-end.

## Usage

You will need to create an SQL database called burger_bonanza, and you will need to update the 'application.properties' to reflect the sign in information/URL for your SQL server.  You will also need to update the spring.mail.username and password in the 'application.properties' file so that emails get sent to you instead of me.

Open in your IDE of choice and click Run.  Once running, navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to access the website.
